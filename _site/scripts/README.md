## üìã **Script Development History**

1. **`fix-liquid-syntax.sh`** - First attempt, had complexity issues
2. **`fix-liquid-syntax-simple.sh`** - Simplified approach, still had issues
3. **`fix-liquid-final.sh`** - HTML entity approach, mixed results
4. **`fix-liquid-complete.sh`** - Comprehensive solution, better results
5. **`fix-liquid-final-complete.sh`** - Final comprehensive solution

## ‚ö†Ô∏è **Important Notes**

- **Backup**: All scripts create backups before making changes
- **Testing**: Each script tests the Jekyll build after making changes
- **Rollback**: If a script fails, you can restore from backups
- **Permissions**: All scripts are executable (`chmod +x`)

## üîß **Troubleshooting**

### **If Scripts Fail**
1. Check that you're in the project root directory
2. Ensure you have the required dependencies (Ruby, Jekyll, etc.)
3. Check the script output for specific error messages
4. Try running the most recent script: `fix-liquid-final-complete.sh`

### **If Jekyll Build Still Fails**
1. Check the specific error message
2. Look for the problematic file mentioned in the error
3. Manually fix the Liquid syntax in that file
4. Test with `bundle exec jekyll build`
