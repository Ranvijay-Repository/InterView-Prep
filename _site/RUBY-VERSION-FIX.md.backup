# Ruby Version Compatibility Fix

## 🎯 **Problem Solved!**

The GitHub Actions workflow was failing due to a Ruby version compatibility issue. Here's what was wrong and how it's been fixed:

## 🔍 **Root Cause**

The error occurred because:
- **GitHub Actions** was using Ruby 3.1.7
- **activesupport-8.0.2.1** gem requires Ruby 3.2.0 or higher
- This created a version incompatibility that prevented the build from completing

## ✅ **Fixes Applied**

### 1. **Updated Ruby Version in Workflows**
- **Deploy Workflow**: Updated from Ruby 3.1 to Ruby 3.2
- **Lint Workflow**: Updated from Ruby 3.1 to Ruby 3.2
- **All Jobs**: Now use consistent Ruby 3.2 version

### 2. **Updated Gemfile**
- **Pinned github-pages gem**: Set to version ~> 232 for better compatibility
- **Ensured compatibility**: With Ruby 3.2 and GitHub Pages

### 3. **Fixed Jekyll Commands**
- **Removed --dry-run flag**: Not supported in the Jekyll version we're using
- **Updated build commands**: To work with the current Jekyll setup

## 📁 **Files Modified**

### GitHub Actions Workflows
- `.github/workflows/deploy.yml` - Updated Ruby version to 3.2
- `.github/workflows/lint.yml` - Updated Ruby version to 3.2, removed --dry-run

### Dependencies
- `Gemfile` - Pinned github-pages gem version

## 🚀 **Current Status**

Your CI/CD pipeline now has:
- ✅ **Compatible Ruby version** (3.2) for all workflows
- ✅ **Updated dependencies** that work with Ruby 3.2
- ✅ **Fixed Jekyll commands** that will execute properly
- ✅ **Consistent configuration** across all workflows

## 🧪 **Testing**

The workflows should now:
1. **Install dependencies** without version conflicts
2. **Build Jekyll site** successfully
3. **Deploy to GitHub Pages** when PRs are merged
4. **Pass all linting checks** on PRs

## 🎉 **Result**

Your GitHub Actions workflows are now compatible and should run successfully without the Ruby version error. The CI/CD pipeline is ready for:

- ✅ **Automatic deployment** on PR merges to production
- ✅ **Linting and validation** on all PRs
- ✅ **GitHub Pages deployment** without errors

**🎯 The Ruby version compatibility issue is now resolved!**
