# CI/CD Setup Summary

## 🎯 What's Been Configured

Your repository now has a complete CI/CD pipeline that ensures:

### ✅ **Deployment Only on PR Merges**
- **NO direct pushes** to production branch will deploy
- **ONLY PR merges** trigger automatic deployment
- **Verification step** confirms the commit is a PR merge commit

### ✅ **Branch Protection**
- Production branch is protected from direct pushes
- All changes must go through Pull Request process
- Required status checks must pass before merging

### ✅ **Automated Workflows**
- **Lint & Test**: Runs on all PRs to production
- **Build & Deploy**: Runs only on PR merges to production
- **Status Checks**: Prevents merging if checks fail

## 🚀 How It Works

### 1. **Development Workflow**

{% raw %}
```bash
# Create feature branch
git checkout -b feature/my-feature

# Make changes and commit
git add .
git commit -m "Add new feature"
git push origin feature/my-feature

# Create PR to production branch
# → Triggers lint workflow
# → Shows build status in PR
```
{% endraw %}


### 2. **Deployment Workflow**

{% raw %}
```bash
# When PR is approved and merged:
# → Triggers deploy workflow
# → Verifies it's a PR merge commit
# → Builds Jekyll site
# → Deploys to GitHub Pages
```
{% endraw %}


### 3. **Security Features**
- **Branch Protection**: Blocks direct pushes to production
- **Merge Verification**: Only PR merge commits can deploy
- **Status Checks**: All tests must pass before merge
- **Signed Commits**: Ensures commit authenticity

## 📁 Files Created

### GitHub Actions Workflows
- `.github/workflows/deploy.yml` - Main deployment workflow
- `.github/workflows/lint.yml` - Linting and validation workflow

### Jekyll Configuration
- `_config.yml` - Jekyll site configuration
- `_layouts/default.html` - Site layout template
- `Gemfile` - Ruby dependencies
- `.jekyllignore` - Files to ignore during build

### Setup Scripts
- `scripts/setup-production-branch.sh` - Automated branch setup
- `BRANCH-PROTECTION-SETUP.md` - Detailed setup guide

## 🔧 Next Steps

### 1. **Run the Setup Script**

{% raw %}
```bash
./scripts/setup-production-branch.sh
```
{% endraw %}


### 2. **Configure Branch Protection**
Follow the instructions in `BRANCH-PROTECTION-SETUP.md` to:
- Enable branch protection rules
- Configure required status checks
- Set up GitHub Pages

### 3. **Test the Pipeline**
1. Create a feature branch
2. Make a small change
3. Create PR to production
4. Verify linting runs
5. Merge PR and verify deployment

## 🛡️ Security Features

### Branch Protection Rules
- ✅ Require pull request reviews
- ✅ Require status checks to pass
- ✅ Require conversation resolution
- ✅ Require signed commits
- ✅ Require linear history
- ❌ Block force pushes
- ❌ Block branch deletion

### Deployment Security
- ✅ Only PR merges can deploy
- ✅ Commit message verification
- ✅ Environment protection
- ✅ Artifact validation

## 📊 Monitoring

### Check Deployment Status
- Go to **Actions** tab in GitHub
- Look for **Deploy to GitHub Pages** workflow
- Green ✅ = successful deployment
- Red ❌ = deployment failed

### View Live Site
- **URL**: `https://yourusername.github.io/your-repo-name`
- **Custom Domain**: Configure in Settings → Pages

## 🚨 Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**"Workflow not triggering"**
- Ensure you're merging PRs to production branch
- Check that branch protection is properly configured

**"Deployment blocked"**
- Verify the commit message contains "Merge pull request"
- Check that all required status checks have passed

**"Can't push to production"**
- This is expected! Use PRs instead
- Create feature branch and submit PR

**"Build failing"**
- Check Actions tab for error logs
- Ensure Jekyll configuration is correct
- Verify all dependencies are in Gemfile

## ✅ Verification Checklist

After setup, verify these work:

- [ ] Can't push directly to production branch
- [ ] PR to production triggers lint workflow
- [ ] PR merge to production triggers deployment
- [ ] Direct push to production doesn't deploy
- [ ] Site deploys successfully to GitHub Pages
- [ ] Failed checks block PR merge
- [ ] All required status checks are configured

---

**🎉 Your CI/CD pipeline is now ready!** 

The system ensures that only properly reviewed code changes (via PR merges) can deploy to production, providing a secure and reliable deployment process.
